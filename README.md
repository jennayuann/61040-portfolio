# Template Portfolio
This will be your portfolio repository. Use this as a [template repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-template-repository) and customize it to your own tastes. We gave you a starting point with a space to describe yourself and a link to where your assignment 1 file can be.

# About Me
*My name is Jenna Yuan, I'm a junior at MIT studying computer science and engineering!*

Some fun facts about me:
1. I really love dark chocolate.
2. I'm allergic to many fruits in the summer time and it varies every year.
3. I have naturally really shaky hands.
