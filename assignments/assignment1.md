# Assignment 1: Problem Framing

# Domains:
1. **Baking** — I love baking and keep an archive of recipes I find online, which I adjust to my own preferences.
2. **Group Hangouts** — Most of my hangouts are with groups of friends, usually going out to eat.
3. **Music** — I'm always listening to music, and finding a good underrated song makes my day.
4. **Campus Dining** — I eat at the campus dining hall for breakfast, lunch, and dinner at least six days a week.
5. **Fitness and Wellness** — This year, I've been trying to work out more consistently and get fit.
6. **Travel** — I love traveling with friends and family, and I'm usually the one who plans everything.
7. **Event Discovery** — I'm a huge explorer and always searching for something exciting to do.
8. **Lending Items** — I often lend items to friends and dormmates, and likewise borrow from them.
9. **Daily Planning** — Every night, I plan out the tasks I want to get done the next day.
10. **Class Notes** — I enjoy taking thorough and visually appealing notes for my classes.

## Top 3 Domains:
- **Campus Dining** — I'm required to be on a meal plan since I live in New Vassar, so I eat in the dining halls almost every day for all three meals. Even though I choose the lowest meal plan option, I still end up with extra swipes at the end of the year, which feels like a huge waste. Over time, the dining halls become more frustrating than convenient, partly because the food gets super repetitive, so I often resort to ordering my own food. Since meals aren't cheap and many students prepay for more than they will use, it feels wrong to settle for food options that don't really meet needs. I'm always looking for ways to improve my experience at campus dining halls.
- **Lending Items** — I often lend and borrow items from friends and dormmates, like chargers, tools, calculators, or clothing. Whenever I need something urgently and a friend comes through, it feels like a real lifesaver. It saves me a lot of money and reduces waste, since many of the items I borrow are things I only need once. Being able to share and reuse items has saved me a lot of stress and money in urgent situations when I don't have the time or capacity to purchase what I need. A good example is when I realized that I lost my calculator right before my 15.501 final and my roommate lent me one.
- **Daily Planning** — I like to stick to routines. One of my bedtime routines is planning out the next day. I write down all the tasks I want to complete and look over my schedule for the day. Having everything laid out helps me avoid forgetting assignments or deadlines, and knowing what's ahead gives me peace of mind. As someone who has trouble falling asleep, reducing this anxiety makes a big difference. I'm always interested in finding better ways to plan my days more effectively.


# Problems:

### Campus Dining:
1. **Unpredictable Wait Times** — Lines are often long at peak hours, and students don't know how busy it will be before tapping in.
2. **Limited Meal Variety** — Menus feel repetitive and students get tired of the food as the school year progresses.
3. **Unused Swipes** — Students often end up with many leftover meal swipes at the end of the semester.
### Lending Items:
1. **Hard to Find a Match** — It's difficult to match people who need something with people who can lend it.
2. **Asking Around is Awkward** — It can feel uncomfortable to ask around for something you need.
3. **Forgetting Returns and Items Lent** — Items that are lent out can be forgotten or lost.
### Daily Planning:
1. **Many Fragmented Tools** — There are too many scattered tools out there for planning like sticky notes, phone reminders, alarms, and calendars.
2. **Accountability** — People make plans but don't stick to them or forget they made certain plans.
3. **Sudden Thoughts** — Sudden ideas and thoughts can get lost if there isn't an easy way to jot them down instantly and a predetermined place to do so.

## Three Selected Problems:

### Campus Dining: Unpredictable Wait Times
While it's very convenient to eat at a dining hall, it can also be frustrating because lines get very long at peak hours. On top of that, it's hard to know in advance whether there's even space to sit. There have been times when I've gone to New Vassar for lunch and there's no space to sit so I had to take out a green box and eat elsewhere. I would love for there to be a way to avoid the massive crowd. This uncertainty wastes time and makes the overall dining experience less enjoyable.
### Lending Items: Hard to Find a Match
Lending and borrowing items can be a lifesaver in urgent situations. The difficult part is finding someone with the item you need, or someone who needs what you have to lend out. It usually depends on knowing the right person or asking around, which sometimes may not yield results. I included this problem because I've experienced how valuable borrowing can be when it's successful, and I think there's room for a solution that makes matching easier.
### Lending Items: Forgetting Returns and Items Lent
Even when lending and borrowing works smoothly, there's always the risk of forgetting who has what, especially when you lend and borrow a lot in parallel. Items may not be returned on time or they can get lost entirely. This creates mistrust, stress, and can discourage people from participating in the future, even if they want to help. This is an issue I've run into many times.

## The Unselected Problems:
- **Campus Dining: Limited Meal Variety** — I chose not to select this issue because the dining hall menus aren't something I can easily intervene in.
- **Campus Dining: Unused Swipes** — There's already some applications that try to solve this and dining swipes are owned by the school so it's also hard to intervene in.
- **Lending Items: Asking Around is Awkward** — The matching issue already encompasses this issue. If there's a solution for matching, then people won't need to ask around themselves.
- **Daily Planning: Many Fragmented Tools** — Many apps already try to combine planning tools, and it would be hard to find something valuable and unique to add.
- **Daily Planning: Accountability** — Sticking to plans come down to personal discipline and there's only so much an app can do in that aspect.
- **Daily Planning: Sudden Thoughts** — There's already many well known note-taking apps so introducing a tool just for sudden brain dumps would be hard to convince people to adopt.


# Stakeholders:

### Campus Dining: Unpredictable Wait Times
1. **Students** — the people waiting in line and paying for the meal swipes.
2. **Dining Staff** — the workers serving food and managing the crowd.
3. **Campus Administrators** — the people responsible for student satisfaction and dining hall operations.

**Impacts:** Students are directly impacted because long lines at the dining halls waste their limited time in between classes and turn mealtime into a stressful experience when it should be an opportunity to recharge. Dining staff also feel the strain when lines get long to rush their service and offer smaller portions. This rushed pace can lead to burnout, which in turn leads to lower quality service. Campus administrators are impacted as well because if dining is consistently receiving criticism, it reflects poorly on the university.

### Lending Items: Hard to Find a Match
1. **Borrowers** — responsible for returning the items.
2. **Lenders** — at risk of losing or damaging their items.
3. **Community** — relationships can be fostered through helping one another out but can also be strained when items are forgotten or lost.

**Impacts:** Borrowers are directly impacted because if they can't quickly find someone who has the item they need, they may have to spend extra money to buy it or go without it altogether. This would add stress to urgent situations and contribute to waste if the item is only used once. Lenders are also affected because their willingness to share may go unused if they can't find someone who needs what they have to offer and they miss the satisfaction of helping others. At the community level, groups miss out on an easy way to foster collaboration and reduce waste, but it also poses a risk of straining relationships when borrowed items get forgotten or lost.

### Lending Items: Forgetting Returns and Items Lent
1. **Borrowers** — responsible for returning the items.
2. **Lenders** — at risk of losing or damaging their items.
3. **Community** — relationships can be fostered through helping one another out but can also be strained when items are forgotten or lost.

**Impacts:** Borrowers may feel guilty if they forget to return or lose an item, which can make them hesitant to borrow again in the future and strain their relationship with the lender. Lenders lose confidence when their belongings aren't returned on time, returned damaged, or lost, which may discourage them from lending to others in the future. At the community level, repeated problems with damaged or lost items will break trust and strain relationships that were healthy prior.

# Features:

### Campus Dining: Unpredictable Wait Times
1. **Live Crowd Dashboard** — A dashboard that shows real-time dining hall crowd levels and estimated wait times. This would let students better plan out their meal times around busy hours to save time and reduce stress. Dining staff would also benefit from more evenly distributed crowds throughout the day.
2. **Table Availability Tracker** — An indicator of available seating at each dining hall, updated through sensors, wifi-connections, or student tap-ins. The exact way for figuring out seating availability will have to be thought about more thoroughly. This helps students avoid stressful situations where they have food in their hands but no seats to eat in.
3. **Suggestion Alerts** — Push notifications that warn students when their preferred dining hall is about to get busy based on historical patterns. Also notifications to alert students when the crowd drops at their preferred dining hall. This gives students foresight to better schedule their mealtimes, and, again, distribute the crowd more evenly throughout the day.

### Lending Items: Hard to Find a Match
1. **Searchable Item Directory** — An app specific to MIT where students can post items they're willing to lend and search for items they need to borrow. This will match the two students and give them a way to connect. Borrowers can quickly find matches without awkwardly asking around, and lenders have a structured way to share and help peers out.
2. **Urgent Requests** — A way for students to urgently request an item, such as "Need a calculator in the next 2 hours". This would send a notification to all app users. Time-sensitive matching methods like this can be real lifesavers in urgent situations and foster new friendships within the MIT community.
3. **Interest Tags** — Users can tag items or categories they're interested in borrowing or lending. The system would send notifications if a relevant match gets posted so they don't miss out on the opportunity. Borrowers save time by being alerted instead of constantly searching or asking around, and lenders gain more traction and confidence that their items are actually desired.

### Lending Items: Forgetting Returns and Items Lent
1. **Return Reminders** — Automated and polite reminders sent to borrowers when items are close to return time and when they're due to be returned. When reminders are sent out and the actual reminder message can be customized. This reduces forgetfulness for borrowers and helps avoid awkward situations where the lender feels like they're nagging for the item back without straining relationships.
2. **History Log** — A clear log tracking items you've borrowed and lent out. For lenders, it will track which items have been lent out, who borrowed them, and whether they were returned and when. The log could include optional photos for clarity to avoid mix-ups, for example, making sure that if a black calculator was borrowed, a silver one isn't being returned. This feature gives lenders peace of mind, while borrowers can see a transparent record of their borrowings.
3. **Reputation System** — A feedback system where users earn a badge based on their borrowing and lending history. For example, someone who consistently returns items on time can earn a "Trusted Borrower" badge and someone who lends a lot of items can earn a "Star Lender" badge. At the community level, this would encourage good behavior since users know their reliability is visible to others. It would also incentivize repeated usage of the app to earn these badges.
